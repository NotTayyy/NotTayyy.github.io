Portfolio Site

This site will attempt to List and show all possible Cards that Can be affected by the card you choose.

I.E. A Card like "Fire Formation Tenki" states - "When this card is activated: You can add 1 Level 4 or lower Beast-Warrior monster from your Deck to your hand. All Beast-Warrior monsters you control gain 100 ATK. You can only activate 1 "Fire Formation - Tenki" per turn."
  If you insert this card into the Site, It will return to you all the Possible "Level 4 or lower Beast-Warrior monsters" you can search with it. Allowing you to look at possible combos you can make with this card.
